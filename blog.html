                    This is one of my works in progress. Lately, I have been obsessed with space and alien-like things, so I thought I would design an alien character of my own.
                    I'm not sure if I will ever finish it, but I think it looks okay regardless. I was experimenting with a more stylized art style for this, and I quite like how it turned out.
                    At least, I like how the hair turned out.
